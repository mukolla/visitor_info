To solve the problem, I used the md5 hash of the fields: ip_address + user_agent + page_url.
but a variant with the use of a multi-column UNIQUE index is possible

example
UNIQUE KEY `un_visitor` (`ip_address`,`user_agent`, `page_url`)


I solved the problem very quickly, I immediately knew
the answer is how to do it right.


- 80% of the time was taken by the infrastructure to run the code to work.
- 20% needed to understand that you need to turn off adlock :-)
  because the banner.php file was blocked by default.
  I havenâ€™t worked with adware for a long time, adblock should always be turned off here
